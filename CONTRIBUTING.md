# Contribution Guidelines

The ML Inference Advisor (MLIA) project is open for external contributors and
welcomes contributions. Source contributions to MLIA are licensed under the
[Apache-2.0 license](https://spdx.org/licenses/Apache-2.0.html), and all
accepted contributions must have the same license. The contents of these
proprietary directories are not open for source contributions and are covered
separately by `LICENSES/LicenseRef-LICENSE.txt`:

- `src/mlia/_vendor/artifacts/nx-performance-estimator/`
- `src/mlia/resources/nx-performance-estimator/`

This document contains the rules for contributing code to MLIA. All contributed
code must follow these rules before it can be accepted to the main branch of
MLIA.

## Setting up the MLIA plugin repo

First clone the MLIA Neural Technology repository.

```bash
    # Using SSH
    git clone "ssh://git@github.com:arm/mlia-neural-technology.git"
    # Or HTTPS
    git clone "https://github.com/arm/mlia-neural-technology.git"
    cd mlia-neural-technology
    git checkout main
    # git pull is not required upon initial clone but good practice before
    # creating a patch
    git pull
    # Set your username, this must be your real name no pseudonyms or anonymous
    # contributions are accepted.
    git config user.name "FIRST_NAME SECOND_NAME"
    # use the same e-mail you set up your github account with
    git config user.email your@email.address
```

This plugin depends on core functionality provided by the
[`arm/mlia` repository](https://github.com/arm/mlia). Consult that repository
for shared MLIA APIs and behavior; a separate checkout is not required to
contribute to this plugin.

### Pre-Commit Checks

Pre-commit checks help ensure contributions comply with the MLIA coding style
and project policies. Some checks may reformat files automatically. All checks
must pass before a contribution can be merged.

Install the development dependencies, including `pre-commit`, with `uv`:

```bash
    uv sync --group dev
```

Optionally install the Git hooks to run the checks automatically before each
commit:

```bash
    uv run pre-commit install
```

Run all checks manually before opening a pull request. This is the same command
used by continuous integration:

```bash
    uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Commit Messages

For the commit messages, the codebase follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org),
with some customizations. Header description is be capitalized, and the following
commit types are allowed: build, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style, test.

### Sign off

Commit your code using [sign-off](#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco) this
adds a "Signed-off-by" line, required for MLIA contributions.

```bash
    git commit -s -m "fix: your commit message"
```

### Code reviews

This project follows the conventional GitHub pull request flow. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests)
for details of how to create a pull request.

Contributions must go through code review on GitHub. Only reviewed contributions
can go to the main branch of MLIA.

### Reporting bugs

Report bugs by creating GitHub issues. Use the
[`arm/mlia-neural-technology` issue tracker](https://github.com/arm/mlia-neural-technology/issues)
by default.

If the bug is in shared MLIA core functionality rather than this plugin, use
the [`arm/mlia` issue tracker](https://github.com/arm/mlia/issues).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Before the MLIA project accepts your contribution, you need to certify its
origin and give us your permission. To manage this process we use
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) V1.1](https://developercertificate.org/).

To indicate that you agree to the the terms of the DCO, you "sign off" your contribution
by adding a line with your name and e-mail address to every git commit message:

```bash
Signed-off-by: FIRST_NAME SECOND_NAME <your@email.address>
```

You must use your real name, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are accepted.

## In File Copyright Notice

In each source file, include the following copyright notice:

```bash
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright <years changes were made> <copyright holder>.
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

If an open-source file does not conform, update its license header as part of
your contribution. Do not change the licensing of a proprietary file without
explicit authorization from Arm.

## Releases

Official releases are published through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mlia-neural-technology/).

## Development Repository

The development repository is hosted on
[github.com](https://github.com/arm/mlia-neural-technology.git/).

## Continuous Integration

Contributions to MLIA go through testing at the Arm CI system. All unit,
integration and regression tests must pass before a contribution gets merged
to the MLIA main branch.
