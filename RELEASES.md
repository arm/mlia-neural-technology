  Backend (`tosa-checker`) is now deprecated.
  This backend relies on an unmaintained project and is
  no longer actively supported. Deprecation warnings will be displayed when using this backend.

* The test_cluster_simple_model_fully test case in
  test_nn_tensorflow_optimizations_pruning.py has proved to fail
  sporadically for stochastic reasons, due to a threshold not being met.

  approach to run the test, and in the meantime we classify it as a
  known issue.

  compatibility". These are known errors due to some issues present in
  TensorFlow 2.9 but they don't affect the correct result of the operator
  compatibility (MLIA-722/MLIA-723). This will be fixed in a future release of
  MLIA.

## Release 0.4.0

### Feature changes

* Add TOSA operator compatibility via tosa-checker python package
